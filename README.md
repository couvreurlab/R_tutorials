# Tutorials for mapping diversity and conservation evaluation

These tutorials can be used for any region with any type of distribution data.  
The distribution data should have however: Latitude and Longitude fields in decimal degrees (names as *ddlat* and *ddlong*, and the fields whould be seperated by a ';'.  

[Mapping palm distribution and diversity in Ecuador](https://couvreurlab.github.io/R_tutorials/Maps_palms.html)  
In this tutorial I show you how to:
- Create maps with low or high precision (country or regional)
- Plot distribution data on these maps
- Map different types of climatic data
- Generate species or genus richness maps using grids


[Conservation analyses using ConR and Annonaceae in Madagascar](https://couvreurlab.github.io/R_tutorials/Maps_palms.html)  
In this tutorial I show you how to:
- How to plot distribution data on maps (country or regional)
- Prepare distrib ution data for ConR analysis
- Running a simple ConR analysis on multiple species
- Running a 'ConR' analysis using protected areas
- Generate richness maps from 'ConR'
